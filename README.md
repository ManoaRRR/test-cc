# Rice Cooker Simulator Refactoring

## Changes Made

1. **Modularization:**
   - Encapsulated the rice cooker functionality into an object (`riceCooker`).
   - Moved common functions, such as `clearRiceCooker` and `delaySync`, into the rice cooker object for better organization.

2. **Switch Statement for Menu:**
   - Replaced multiple `if-else` statements in the menu handling with a `switch` statement for improved readability.

3. **Enhanced User Interaction:**
   - Improved user prompts and error messages for better clarity.
   - Ensured that the simulator provides meaningful feedback for various user inputs and actions.

4. **Code Readability:**
   - Applied consistent indentation and formatting for better code readability.
   - Used meaningful variable and function names to enhance code understanding.

5. **Code DRYness:**
   - Extracted common checks into dedicated methods to avoid redundancy.
   - Ensured that the `simulateRiceCooker` function focuses on user interaction and menu handling.

6. **Maintained Original Functionality:**
   - Ensured that the refactored code retains the original functionality of the rice cooker simulator.

## Instructions

1. **Setup:**
   - Make sure to install the necessary dependencies using `npm install prompt-sync`.

2. **Run the Simulator:**
   - Execute the program in a Node.js environment using `node your-script-file.js`.

3. **Interact with the Rice Cooker:**
   - Choose options from the menu by entering the corresponding number.
   - Follow the prompts to simulate adding rice, cooking, steaming, keeping warm, and removing rice.

4. **Exiting the Simulator:**
   - To exit the simulator, choose option 6.

## Notes

- The refactoring aimed to enhance code structure, readability, and user interaction while preserving the original functionality.
- The rice cooker simulator provides a simple yet interactive experience for users interested in simulating rice cooking processes.

Feel free to explore the optimized code and experience the virtual rice cooker simulator with improved code organization and user interaction.
